# Hello-World
Random shizz
I'm James, a student new to Web Design and programming. Repurposing from 20+ years in the Construction Industry is a challenge. Fortunately, I like challenging things, and I also enjoy Creating and Fixing Things. I find the tacos on the Moon a bit over-rated (Apologies, Robot!).
